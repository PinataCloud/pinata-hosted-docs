# Dedicated Gateways

For those who need greater speed or increased rate limits when retrieving content, Pinata lets users create their own **dedicated gateways.**

#### **What are the benefits of a dedicated gateway?**

* Unmatched speed through our over 200 edge caching locations around the world
* No rate limits for requesting content

To get started, [you'll need to sign up for a paid plan](https://pinata.cloud/billing). From there, you can go to our [Gateways page to create your first gateway](https://pinata.cloud/gateway).

You can also read additional documentation on how to set up a dedicated gateway [here](broken-reference).
