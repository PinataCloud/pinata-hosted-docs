### Pinata Video Streaming

With Pinata Video Streaming and your Dedicated Gateway, you get access to streaming video. Rather than wait for a video to download entirely, people who want to view your content can stream it in the same way they stream YouTube and Netflix. â€Œ&#x20;

All you have to do is append the following to the end of your gateway URL for any particular video: â€Œ&#x20;

`yourGatewayURL?stream=true` â€Œ&#x20;

This will apply to videos you have uploaded since getting access to the Video Streaming functionality. Any previously uploaded videos will need to be re-uploaded to get access to streaming. â€Œ&#x20;
